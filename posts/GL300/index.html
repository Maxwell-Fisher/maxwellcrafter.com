I bought this device a while back to mess around with. It's a small GPS tracker that uses cellular data, meaning that you can see where it is located in nearly any location where phone service is available
<br>

It charges via mini USB, and so I'm wondering if I could get access to it using that
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a>
After being plugged in for a few minutes to charge, it now shows 2 flashing lights
</a>

Though I still can't get any data from it even after trying a few different button combinations, so I'm thinking that the data lines aren't wired up. Which is strange, because it has the pins that are used for data
</a>

It's held together by 4 screws, but they are covered in a plug thing, making me think that the designers don't want people to know what the inside looks like. What secrets does it contain? A sim card, the meaning of life, or a tiny phone? I guess we'll never know

Luckily the plugs aren't glued in, though it's still a bit difficult to remove them

Opening the case reveals 2 half's â€“ one with a battery

And here are some photos of the PCB (which sadly has annoying shielding)

These pins are for reading a sim card when there is one in the slot. Which there isn't for some reason..?

This is the GPS itself, which I'd say is pretty important for a GPS tracking device

And then there are quite a few test pads, with the main one that I'm interested in being the one that says `SAFEBOOT`
</a>

Here are some photos of what is under the shielding, credit to the device's FCC documents

The photos reveal that this uses a MediaTek MT6261A ARM processor. I'm beginning to have suspicions that this is running Android, or at least something like it
</a>
<br>
<br>
<a>
This is the closest diagram for the processor that I could find, though I'm not sure that it's for the same thing. (It's for the MT6260A, whereas the processor that I have is the MT6261A)
